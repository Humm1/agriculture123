## 🔗 Integration with Existing System

### Updated Files:

- Clean separation with "OR" divider
- Icon for visual appeal

#### 2. **RootNavigator.js**

## 🚀 How It Works

### User Flow:

1. **User goes to Growth Tracking**
   - If no plots exist, sees two options:
     - "Create New Plot" (manual)
     - "Create Demo Plot" (quick demo data)

2. **Manual Plot Creation:**
   ```
   Tap "Create New Plot"
   → Fill in plot details
   → Capture location with GPS
   → Optionally add plant/soil images
   → Submit form
   → Backend creates plot + generates calendar
   → Returns to Growth Tracking with new plot
   ```

3. **Backend Processing:**
   ```
   Receive form data + images
   → Upload images to server
   → Create plot record in database
   → Generate seasonal calendar events
   → Save images to plot_images table
   → Return success with plot details
   ```

4. **Display Results:**
   - Plot appears in user's plot list
   - Calendar events automatically created
   - Growth tracking dashboard shows the new plot
   - Images stored for future reference
