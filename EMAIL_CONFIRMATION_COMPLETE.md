## 🔍 Debugging User Type Redirect

### Check Browser Console After Login:

You should see logs like this:

```
🔔 Auth event: SIGNED_IN
🔔 Session: Active
👤 Fetching profile for user: abc123-uuid...
✅ Profile fetched: {
  id: "abc123-uuid",
  email: "farmer@example.com",
  user_type: "farmer",
  full_name: "Test Farmer"
}
👤 User loaded: abc123-uuid
📋 Profile loaded: {
  id: "abc123-uuid",
  email: "farmer@example.com", 
  user_type: "farmer",
  full_name: "Test Farmer"
}
```

### If Redirected to Wrong Dashboard:

Check the `user_type` in the console logs:
- **If `user_type: "farmer"`** but going to Buyer Dashboard → Profile data mismatch
- **If `user_type: undefined` or `null`** → Profile not loaded correctly
- **If `user_type: "buyer"` but you registered as farmer** → Wrong data saved in database

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Profile not found in database"

**Console shows:** `⚠️ Profile not found in database for user: [uuid]`

**Solution:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → profiles
2. Check if the user's profile exists
3. If missing, the trigger might not have fired
4. Verify the SQL setup script ran successfully
5. Check if RLS policies are blocking inserts

### Issue 2: Wrong `user_type` in database

**Check in Supabase:**
1. Go to Table Editor → profiles
2. Find the user's row
3. Check the `user_type` column
4. Should be either "farmer" or "buyer"
5. If wrong, manually update it

### Issue 3: Still redirecting to wrong dashboard

**After confirming user_type is correct:**
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Log out completely
3. Restart Expo server: `npx expo start --clear --web`
4. Log in again
5. Check console for profile data

### Issue 4: Email confirmation not working

**In Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to Authentication → Settings → Email Auth
2. Check "Enable email confirmations" status
3. Verify email templates are configured
4. Check Authentication → Users to see if user status is "confirmed"

---

## 📊 Database Check

### Verify Profile Data in Supabase:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Click **Table Editor** → **profiles**
3. Find your test user
4. Check these columns:
   - `id` - Should match auth.users id
   - `email` - Correct email
   - `user_type` - Should be "farmer" or "buyer"
   - `full_name` - Name from registration
   - `county`, `subcounty`, `village` - Location data
   - `latitude`, `longitude` - Coordinates (if provided)

### If Data is Missing or Wrong:

Run this query in SQL Editor to check:

```sql
SELECT 
  p.*,
  u.email as auth_email,
  u.confirmed_at
FROM profiles p
JOIN auth.users u ON u.id = p.id
WHERE p.email = 'your-test-email@example.com';
```
