## 1. AI Hyper-Local Prediction (The "Brain")

### Core Innovation

The **Predictive Fusion Model** synthesizes multiple weather data sources with dynamic trust scoring:

- **Satellite Data** (85% initial trust): Low resolution but reliable
- **Crowdsourced Farmer Reports** (65% initial trust): High resolution but variable accuracy
- **BLE Sensor Data** (90% initial trust): Real-time but localized

**Key Feature:** Trust scores adapt over time based on prediction accuracy. Farmer A's reports may earn 85% trust while Farmer B's reports drop to 45% trust.

### 1.1 ML-Powered Micro-Climate Forecasting

**Function:** `synthesize_micro_climate_forecast(lat, lon, forecast_days=7)`

**Example: Village-Level Forecast**

```python
from app.services.ai_hyperlocal_prediction import synthesize_micro_climate_forecast

forecast = synthesize_micro_climate_forecast(
    lat=-1.2921,
    lon=36.8219,
    forecast_days=7
)

print(forecast)
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "location": {"lat": -1.2921, "lon": 36.8219},
  "forecast": [
    {
      "date": "2025-10-24",
      "day_index": 0,
      "temperature": 23.5,
      "temperature_confidence": 0.92,
      "humidity": 75.2,
      "humidity_confidence": 0.88,
      "rainfall_mm": 4.5,
      "rainfall_mm_confidence": 0.80,
      "conditions": "light_rain",
      "overall_confidence": 0.87
    }
  ],
  "data_sources": {
    "satellite": {"trust_score": 0.85, "active": true},
    "crowdsourced": {"trust_score": 0.68, "active": true, "num_reports": 5},
    "ble_sensors": {"trust_score": 0.90, "active": true}
  },
  "model_confidence": 0.81
}
```

**How It Works:**

1. **Weighted Synthesis**: Each data source contributes based on trust score:
   - Satellite: 85% weight
   - Crowdsourced (5 reports, avg 68% trust): Variable weight by farmer reliability
   - BLE sensors: 90% weight

2. **Proximity Weighting**: Crowdsourced reports weighted by distance:
   - 5km away = 100% weight
   - 10km away = 60% weight (exponential decay)
   - 20km away = 14% weight

3. **Farmer Reliability Tracking**: 
   ```python
   update_source_reliability("crowdsourced", prediction_correct=True, farmer_id="farmer_001")
   ```
   - Farmer_001: 10 correct, 2 incorrect ‚Üí Trust score = 83%
   - Farmer_002: 5 correct, 7 incorrect ‚Üí Trust score = 42%

**Benefit:** Achieves village-level precision (5-10km radius) vs. national weather models (50-100km resolution).

### 1.2 AI-Driven Disease & Pest Forecasting

**Function:** `predict_pest_disease_outbreaks(crop, lat, lon, micro_climate_forecast)`

**Example: Pre-Emptive Late Blight Alert**

```python
from app.services.ai_hyperlocal_prediction import (
    synthesize_micro_climate_forecast,
    predict_pest_disease_outbreaks
)

# Get micro-climate forecast
forecast = synthesize_micro_climate_forecast(-1.2921, 36.8219, forecast_days=7)

# Predict pest outbreaks for potato crop
predictions = predict_pest_disease_outbreaks(
    crop="potato",
    lat=-1.2921,
    lon=36.8219,
    micro_climate_forecast=forecast,
    historical_outbreak_radius_km=50
)

print(predictions[0])  # Highest risk prediction
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "pathogen_id": "late_blight",
  "pathogen_name": "Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans)",
  "pathogen_type": "fungal",
  "affected_crop": "potato",
  "outbreak_probability": 0.75,
  "risk_category": "high",
  "predicted_activation_date": "2025-10-26",
  "days_until_activation": 2,
  "visible_symptoms_date": "2025-10-29",
  "days_until_visible_symptoms": 5,
  "preventative_window_closes": "2025-10-24 18:00",
  "hours_to_take_action": 6,
  "triggering_conditions": [
    "Optimal temperature (18¬∞C)",
    "High humidity (92%)",
    "Rainfall forecast (12mm)"
  ],
  "historical_outbreaks_nearby": 3,
  "preventative_actions": [
    "Remove infected plants immediately",
    "Improve field drainage",
    "Apply copper-based fungicide preventatively"
  ],
  "expected_severity_if_untreated": "severe",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "ai_reasoning": "Weather conditions favor outbreak in 2 days. 3 historical outbreaks within 50km. Risk score: 7.5/10."
}
```

**Farmer SMS Alert:**
> üö® **High Blight Risk:** Conditions give a 75% chance of potato blight activation starting in 48 hours. Begin preventative action NOW. You have 6 hours before window closes.

**How It Works:**

1. **Pathogen Life Cycle Matching**: Checks if weather forecast matches activation conditions:
   - Late Blight requires: 10-25¬∞C + 90% humidity + 12h consecutive rain
   - Fall Armyworm requires: 25-30¬∞C + 60% humidity + 2 dry days

2. **Historical Outbreak Risk**: Searches 50km radius for past outbreaks:
   - 0 outbreaks = 1.0√ó risk multiplier
   - 1-2 outbreaks = 1.2√ó multiplier
   - 3-5 outbreaks = 1.5√ó multiplier
   - 6+ outbreaks = 2.0√ó multiplier

3. **Risk Scoring (0-10 scale)**:
   ```
   Base risk = 8.0 (if activation in ‚â§2 days)
   Final risk = Base √ó Historical multiplier
   Example: 8.0 √ó 1.5 = 12.0 ‚Üí capped at 10.0
   ```

4. **Preventative Window Calculation**:
   - Late Blight: 48 hours before activation
   - Fall Armyworm: 72 hours before activation
   - Action deadline = Activation date - Preventative window

**Benefit:** Farmers get 48-72 hour advance warning with specific probability (e.g., "75% chance") instead of generic "high humidity" alerts.

---

## 2. AI Smart Recommendations (The "Advisor")

### Core Innovation

Moves from generic advice ("Plant maize in March") to **personalized, risk-adjusted recommendations** based on:

- Real-time LCRS (Climate Risk Score) + SMI (Soil Moisture Index)
- Farmer's historical practices (organic vs. chemical, mulching frequency)
- Crop price volatility + yield risk analysis

### 2.1 Dynamic Calendar Optimization

**Function:** `optimize_planting_window(crop, lat, lon, field_id)`

**Example: Maize Planting Optimization**

```python
from app.services.ai_smart_recommendations import optimize_planting_window

optimization = optimize_planting_window(
    crop="maize",
    lat=-1.2921,
    lon=36.8219,
    field_id="field_001",
    lcrs=5.5,  # Moderate climate risk
    smi=6.8    # Good soil moisture
)

print(optimization)
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "crop": "maize",
  "location": {"lat": -1.2921, "lon": 36.8219},
  "current_date": "2025-10-24",
  "optimal_planting_date": "2025-10-29",
  "days_until_optimal": 5,
  "recommendation": "‚è≥ **WAIT 5 DAYS:** Delaying planting increases yield by 12.3% (308 kg more).",
  "planting_today": {
    "planting_date": "2025-10-24",
    "days_from_today": 0,
    "predicted_yield_kg": 2500,
    "yield_vs_optimal_percent": 87.7,
    "risk_factors": ["Outside optimal planting window (10% penalty)"],
    "confidence": 0.82
  },
  "planting_optimal": {
    "planting_date": "2025-10-29",
    "days_from_today": 5,
    "predicted_yield_kg": 2808,
    "yield_vs_optimal_percent": 100.0,
    "risk_factors": [],
    "confidence": 0.85
  },
  "yield_improvement_if_wait": {
    "kg_per_acre": 308,
    "percent": 12.3
  },
  "environmental_conditions": {
    "lcrs": 5.5,
    "smi": 6.8,
    "current_weather": {...}
  },
  "ai_confidence": 0.85
}
```

**Farmer Guidance:**
> ‚è≥ **Planting Window Optimized:** Planting in 5 days maximizes your yield potential by 12.3% (308 kg more per acre) compared to planting today, despite a slight risk of early dry-out.

**How It Works:**

1. **Yield Simulation**: Simulates yield for planting dates from -10 to +20 days:
   - Each date gets penalties for:
     - **Planting window penalty**: Distance from optimal (peak = day 0, edges = -10/+10 days)
     - **Weather penalty**: Rainfall deficit, temperature stress during growth
     - **Climate risk penalty**: LCRS 10 = 50% yield reduction
     - **Soil moisture penalty**: SMI 7.0 = optimal, deviations penalized

2. **Yield Formula**:
   ```
   Final Yield = Base Yield √ó Window Penalty √ó Weather Penalty √ó LCRS Penalty √ó SMI Penalty
   
   Example (Maize):
   Base = 2500 kg/acre
   Today (day 0): 2500 √ó 0.90 √ó 0.95 √ó 0.95 √ó 0.98 = 2107 kg
   Optimal (day +5): 2500 √ó 1.00 √ó 1.00 √ó 0.95 √ó 0.98 = 2328 kg
   Improvement: 221 kg = 10.5%
   ```

3. **Recommendation Logic**:
   - If optimal is today (day 0) ‚Üí "PLANT TODAY"
   - If yield improvement ‚â•10% ‚Üí "WAIT X DAYS"
   - If yield improvement 5-10% ‚Üí "SLIGHT ADVANTAGE TO WAIT"
   - If optimal passed (negative days) ‚Üí "OPTIMAL WINDOW PASSED, PLANT ASAP"

**Benefit:** Farmers get quantified yield improvement (e.g., "12% more") vs. vague advice like "wait for rains."

### 2.2 AI-Driven Financial Risk Scenarios

**Function:** `generate_financial_risk_scenarios(crops, lat, lon, field_size_acres)`

**Example: Compare Maize vs. Sorghum**

```python
from app.services.ai_smart_recommendations import generate_financial_risk_scenarios

scenarios = generate_financial_risk_scenarios(
    crops=["maize", "sorghum", "beans"],
    lat=-1.2921,
    lon=36.8219,
    field_size_acres=2.5,
    farmer_id="farmer_001",
    lcrs=6.5  # Moderate-high climate risk
)

print(scenarios["scenarios"])
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "scenarios": [
    {
      "crop": "sorghum",
      "predicted_yield_kg": 4375,
      "yield_risk_percent": 26.0,
      "predicted_price_kes_per_kg": 55,
      "price_volatility_percent": 15.0,
      "gross_revenue_kes": 240625,
      "production_cost_kes": 30000,
      "net_profit_kes": 210625,
      "profit_scenarios": {
        "best_case": 289406,
        "expected": 210625,
        "worst_case": 160000
      },
      "risk_score": 20.5,
      "risk_category": "low",
      "recommendation_score": 88.2
    },
    {
      "crop": "maize",
      "predicted_yield_kg": 5000,
      "yield_risk_percent": 52.0,
      "predicted_price_kes_per_kg": 50,
      "price_volatility_percent": 25.0,
      "gross_revenue_kes": 250000,
      "production_cost_kes": 37500,
      "net_profit_kes": 212500,
      "profit_scenarios": {
        "best_case": 337500,
        "expected": 212500,
        "worst_case": 112500
      },
      "risk_score": 38.5,
      "risk_category": "moderate",
      "recommendation_score": 76.8
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "highest_profit": {
      "crop": "maize",
      "net_profit_kes": 212500,
      "risk_score": 38.5
    },
    "lowest_risk": {
      "crop": "sorghum",
      "net_profit_kes": 210625,
      "risk_score": 20.5
    },
    "recommended": {
      "crop": "sorghum",
      "net_profit_kes": 210625,
      "risk_score": 20.5,
      "reasoning": "Best balance of profit (210,625 KES) and risk (20.5%). Safe option."
    }
  }
}
```

**Farmer Guidance:**
> üí∞ **Financial Analysis:**
> - **Option 1 (Maize):** Expected profit 212,500 KES, but **52% risk of failure** (worst case: 112,500 KES)
> - **Option 2 (Sorghum):** Expected profit 210,625 KES, with only **26% risk** (worst case: 160,000 KES)
> 
> **Recommendation:** Plant Sorghum. Nearly identical profit (2% less) but half the risk. Safe choice in uncertain climate.

**How It Works:**

1. **Yield Risk Calculation**:
   ```
   Base Risk = LCRS √ó 5  (LCRS 10 = 50% risk)
   Adjusted Risk = Base √ó (0.5 + Crop Water Sensitivity √ó 0.5)
   
   Example:
   Maize (high water sensitivity = 0.8):
   Risk = 6.5 √ó 5 √ó (0.5 + 0.8 √ó 0.5) = 32.5 √ó 0.9 = 29.3%
   
   Sorghum (drought tolerant = 0.4):
   Risk = 6.5 √ó 5 √ó (0.5 + 0.4 √ó 0.5) = 32.5 √ó 0.7 = 22.8%
   ```

2. **Price Projections**: Uses seasonal multipliers:
   - Harvest season: 0.7√ó (supply glut)
   - Planting season: 1.0√ó
   - Lean season: 1.3√ó (low supply)

3. **Profit Scenarios**:
   - **Best case**: 120% of predicted yield √ó high price (+ volatility)
   - **Expected**: Predicted yield √ó expected price
   - **Worst case**: (100% - yield risk) √ó low price (- volatility)

4. **Recommendation Score** (0-100):
   ```
   Profit Score = min(Net Profit / 2000, 100)  # Normalize to 0-100
   Risk Penalty = Risk Score
   
   Final Score = Profit Score √ó (1 - Risk Weight) + (100 - Risk Penalty) √ó Risk Weight
   
   Risk Weight = 0.5 (medium tolerance, default)
                 0.3 (high tolerance, for risk-seeking farmers)
                 0.7 (low tolerance, for risk-averse farmers)
   ```

**Benefit:** Farmers see risk-adjusted comparisons instead of just "Maize yields more." Example: Sorghum yields 12% less but has 50% lower failure risk.

---

### 2.3 AI-Personalized Micro-Action Alerts

**Function:** `generate_personalized_alert(farmer_id, crop, crop_stage, alert_type)`

**Example 1: Water Stress Alert (Farmer with Mulching History)**

```python
from app.services.ai_smart_recommendations import generate_personalized_alert

# Farmer_001 has history of mulching (tracked from past actions)
alert = generate_personalized_alert(
    farmer_id="farmer_001",
    crop="maize",
    crop_stage="flowering",
    days_since_planting=60,
    current_weather={"temperature": 28, "humidity": 35, "rainfall_mm": 0},
    smi=3.5,  # Low soil moisture
    alert_type="water_stress"
)

print(alert)
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "alert_type": "water_stress",
  "severity": "critical",
  "crop": "maize",
  "crop_stage": "flowering",
  "message": "üíß **Water Alert:** Since you've already mulched and no rain is coming, consider targeted spot watering for your maize to save the weakest plants.",
  "smi": 3.5,
  "recommended_actions": [
    "Targeted manual watering (focus on stressed plants)",
    "Weed control (reduces water competition)"
  ],
  "urgency": "high",
  "personalization_factors": {
    "fertilizer_preference": "organic",
    "mulching_frequency": "always",
    "irrigation_access": "manual"
  }
}
```

**Farmer SMS (Personalized for Farmer_001):**
> üíß **Water Alert:** Since you've already mulched and no rain is coming, consider targeted spot watering for your maize to save the weakest plants.

**Example 2: Same Alert for Farmer without Mulching**

```python
# Farmer_002 has no mulching history
alert = generate_personalized_alert(
    farmer_id="farmer_002",
    crop="maize",
    crop_stage="flowering",
    days_since_planting=60,
    current_weather={"temperature": 28, "humidity": 35, "rainfall_mm": 0},
    smi=3.5,
    alert_type="water_stress"
)
```

**Farmer SMS (Generic for Farmer_002):**
> üíß **URGENT Water Alert:** Maize at flowering stage needs water! No rain forecast. Apply mulch immediately to conserve soil moisture. Consider emergency manual watering for critical plants.

**How It Works:**

1. **Farmer Practice Profiling**: Tracks actions over time:
   ```python
   update_farmer_practice_profile(
       farmer_id="farmer_001",
       action="mulching",
       context={"crop": "maize", "date": "2025-09-15"}
   )
   ```
   - After 2+ mulching events ‚Üí Profile = "always"
   - After 0 mulching events in 5+ actions ‚Üí Profile = "never"

2. **Preference Inference**:
   - Fertilizer: Organic (>67% organic actions) vs. Chemical vs. Mixed
   - Irrigation: None (0 irrigation) vs. Manual (1-5) vs. Automatic (5+)
   - Risk tolerance: High/Medium/Low (inferred from past crop choices)

3. **Alert Personalization**:
   - Farmer with mulching history ‚Üí Assume mulch already applied, skip that step
   - Farmer with no irrigation ‚Üí Emphasize mulching as alternative
   - Farmer with organic preference ‚Üí Recommend composted manure, not CAN

**Benefit:** Alerts are actionable and context-specific. Farmer_001 doesn't get told to "apply mulch" when they already did it last week.

## 3. AI Real-Time Monitoring (The "Field Scout")

### Core Innovation

Combines computer vision diagnostics with spatial-temporal outbreak analysis:

- **Severity-based triage**: 5% damage ‚Üí organic treatment, 50% damage ‚Üí chemical intervention
- **Confidence-based expert routing**: <65% confidence ‚Üí extension officer verifies
- **Vector-aware contagion modeling**: Wind + road networks predict spread patterns

### 3.1 AI Diagnostic Triage & Severity Scoring

**Function:** `analyze_pest_disease_severity(image_data, crop)`

**Example: Pest Diagnosis with Confidence Triage**

```python
from app.services.ai_field_scout import analyze_pest_disease_severity

diagnosis = analyze_pest_disease_severity(
    image_data=open("maize_leaf.jpg", "rb").read(),
    crop="maize"
)

print(diagnosis)
```

**Output (High Confidence Case):**
```json
{
  "pest_disease_id": "fall_armyworm",
  "pest_disease_name": "Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda)",
  "cv_confidence": 0.88,
  "adjusted_confidence": 0.88,
  "confidence_category": "very_high",
  "damage_extent_percent": 15.3,
  "infection_stage": "early",
  "severity_score": 3.2,
  "severity_category": "moderate",
  "intervention_urgency": "medium",
  "treatment_strategy": "enhanced_organic",
  "image_quality": {
    "brightness": 0.85,
    "sharpness": 0.92,
    "resolution": 0.88,
    "leaf_visibility": 0.90,
    "overall_quality": 0.89
  },
  "requires_expert_verification": false,
  "triage_reason": "High confidence AI diagnosis",
  "expert_routing": null,
  "farmer_action": "proceed_with_ai_recommendation",
  "ai_reasoning": "Identified as Fall Armyworm with 88.0% confidence. Severity: moderate (3.2/10). Recommended treatment: enhanced_organic."
}
```

**Farmer Guidance (High Confidence):**
> ‚úÖ **Fall Armyworm Detected** (88% confidence)
> - Severity: Moderate (15% leaf damage)
> - Action: Enhanced organic treatment (Bt spray + neem oil)
> - Urgency: Medium (treat within 3 days)

**Output (Low Confidence Case):**
```json
{
  "pest_disease_id": "maize_streak_virus",
  "cv_confidence": 0.58,
  "adjusted_confidence": 0.52,
  "confidence_category": "low",
  "damage_extent_percent": 25.0,
  "severity_score": 5.8,
  "severity_category": "severe",
  "requires_expert_verification": true,
  "triage_reason": "CV confidence below 65% threshold",
  "expert_routing": {
    "route_to": "extension_officer",
    "urgency": "priority",
    "estimated_response_time": "within 24 hours"
  },
  "farmer_action": "wait_for_expert",
  "ai_reasoning": "Identified as Maize Streak Virus with 58.0% confidence. Expert verification required: CV confidence below 65% threshold."
}
```

**Farmer Guidance (Low Confidence):**
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Possible Maize Streak Virus** (52% confidence - LOW)
> - Your case has been forwarded to an extension officer for expert confirmation
> - Expected response: Within 24 hours
> - Action: DO NOT treat until expert confirms diagnosis

**How It Works:**

1. **Severity Scoring (0-10)**:
   ```
   Base Score = (Damage Extent % / 100) √ó 10
   
   Stage Multipliers:
   - Early: 0.8√ó
   - Moderate: 1.0√ó
   - Advanced: 1.3√ó
   
   Damage Type Multipliers:
   - Leaf damage: 1.0√ó
   - Stem damage: 1.2√ó
   - Fruit damage: 1.3√ó
   - Root damage: 1.4√ó
   
   Final Score = Base √ó Stage Multiplier √ó Damage Multiplier
   
   Example (Fall Armyworm):
   Base = (15.3 / 100) √ó 10 = 1.53
   Final = 1.53 √ó 0.8 (early) √ó 1.2 (stem damage) = 1.47
   ```

2. **Treatment Strategy by Severity**:
   - **Mild (<3.0)**: Organic IPM (cultural methods + neem spray)
   - **Moderate (3.0-5.0)**: Enhanced organic (Bt + neem + pheromone traps)
   - **Severe (5.0-7.5)**: Targeted chemical (selective pesticides)
   - **Critical (>7.5)**: Rapid chemical (broad-spectrum, immediate)

3. **Confidence Adjustment**:
   ```
   Adjusted Confidence = CV Confidence √ó Image Quality Penalty
   
   Quality Penalties:
   - Overall quality <0.6: 0.75√ó (25% penalty)
   - Overall quality 0.6-0.8: 0.90√ó (10% penalty)
   - Overall quality >0.8: 1.0√ó (no penalty)
   
   Example (Poor lighting):
   CV = 0.88, Quality = 0.55
   Adjusted = 0.88 √ó 0.75 = 0.66
   ```

4. **Triage Routing Logic**:
   - **Confidence <65%**: Always route to expert (URGENT if severity >7.5)
   - **Confidence 65-75%**: Route if severity >5.0 OR poor image quality
   - **Confidence >75%**: Proceed with AI recommendation

**Benefit:** Prevents misdiagnosis disasters. Farmer never applies expensive chemicals based on 52% confidence AI guess.

### 3.2 AI-Triggered Contagion Modeling

**Function:** `analyze_contagion_patterns(pest_disease_id, recent_reports, wind_data, road_network)`

**Example: Wind-Driven Outbreak**

**Regional Alert (All Farmers within 13.5km):**
> üêõüêõ **OUTBREAK WARNING:** Fall Armyworm outbreak spreading Southeast at 2.8 km/day. Wind-driven contagion detected. Clean tools and clothing before entering your field. Inspect crops DAILY.

**How It Works:**

1. **Spatial Clustering**: Groups reports within 5km radius:
   ```
   Cluster 1: 5 reports
   Centroid: (-1.34, 36.88)
   Radius: 8.5 km
   ```

2. **Spread Vector Analysis**:
   - Calculate bearing between consecutive reports:
     ```
     Report 1 ‚Üí Report 2: Bearing = 135¬∞ (Southeast)
     Report 2 ‚Üí Report 3: Bearing = 138¬∞ (Southeast)
     Average bearing = 136¬∞
     ```
   - Compare to wind direction (135¬∞):
     ```
     Bearing diff = |136¬∞ - 135¬∞| = 1¬∞ < 45¬∞
     Wind-aligned = TRUE
     ```

3. **Spread Rate Calculation**:
   ```
   Distance = 9.2 km (Report 1 ‚Üí Report 5)
   Days = 19 days
   Spread Rate = 9.2 / 19 = 0.48 km/day
   
   But if wind speed >10 km/h:
   Adjusted Rate = 2.8 km/day (uses wind speed factor)
   ```

4. **Contagion Type Classification**:
   - **Rapid airborne**: Wind-aligned + spread >2 km/day
   - **Human-mediated**: Road-aligned (reports follow main road)
   - **Multiple sources**: ‚â•2 hotspots >20km apart
   - **Localized**: Single hotspot, no clear vector

5. **Alert Radius Expansion**:
   ```
   Base Radius = Hotspot radius (8.5 km) + 5 km buffer = 13.5 km
   If spread rate >2 km/day: +5 km ‚Üí 18.5 km
   ```

**Benefit:** Alerts specify spread method ("Wind-driven Southeast" vs. "Along main road") enabling targeted prevention (e.g., "Clean tools" for road-mediated spread).

}
```

**Farmer SMS:**
> üå± **URGENT NUTRIENT ALERT:** Your maize leaves are showing early yellowing (low Nitrogen). Pull forward your next fertilizer session by 5 days. Apply composted manure or CAN NOW.

**How It Works:**

1. **NDVI Proxy Calculation** (from photos):
   - **Computer vision** analyzes:
     - Leaf color (greenness): 0-1 scale (1 = deep green)
     - Foliage density: 0-1 scale (1 = full canopy)
     - Plant vigor: Combined metric
   
   - **NDVI Proxy** = Weighted average:
     ```
     NDVI = (Leaf Color √ó 0.6) + (Foliage Density √ó 0.4)
     
     Example:
     Week 1: (0.85 √ó 0.6) + (0.80 √ó 0.4) = 0.83 (Healthy)
     Week 4: (0.58 √ó 0.6) + (0.70 √ó 0.4) = 0.63 (Declining)
     ```

2. **Trend Analysis**:
   ```
   NDVI Change = Current NDVI - 3 weeks ago NDVI
   
   Change > 0.1: "improving"
   Change < -0.1: "declining"
   Otherwise: "stable"
   
   Example: 0.63 - 0.83 = -0.20 (declining)
   ```

3. **Nutrient Deficiency Diagnosis**:
   - **Nitrogen deficiency** indicators:
     - Leaf color <0.65 (yellowing)
     - NDVI declining
     - Confidence = 85% if both present
   
   - **Severity**:
     - Leaf color <0.55 = "moderate"
     - Leaf color 0.55-0.65 = "mild"

4. **Fertilizer Timing Adjustment**:
   - **Moderate severity**: Advance by 5 days, apply immediately
   - **Mild severity**: Advance by 2 days, apply within 3 days

**Benefit:** Eliminates need for expensive soil testing. Farmer gets nitrogen alert from weekly phone photos, saving 500-1000 KES on lab tests.

## 5. Farmer Workflows

### Workflow 1: Pre-Season Planning (The Brain + The Advisor)

**Goal:** Decide which crop to plant and when.

**Steps:**

1. **Get Micro-Climate Forecast** (The Brain)
   ```
   Farmer opens app ‚Üí "Weather Forecast" tab
   App calls: /api/predict/micro-climate
   Display: 7-day village-level forecast
   ```

2. **Get Pest Outbreak Predictions** (The Brain)
   ```
   Farmer enters crop choice: "Potato"
   App calls: /api/predict/pest-outbreak (crop=potato)
   Display: "üö® 75% chance of Late Blight in 2 days. Take preventative action."
   ```

3. **Compare Financial Scenarios** (The Advisor)
   ```
   Farmer: "I'm deciding between Maize and Sorghum"
   App calls: /api/advisor/financial-scenarios (crops=[maize, sorghum])
   Display comparison table:
   - Maize: 212,500 KES profit, 52% risk
   - Sorghum: 210,625 KES profit, 26% risk
   Recommendation: "Sorghum (nearly same profit, half the risk)"
   ```

4. **Optimize Planting Date** (The Advisor)
   ```
   Farmer: "When should I plant Sorghum?"
   App calls: /api/advisor/optimize-planting (crop=sorghum)
   Display: "‚è≥ Wait 5 days for 12% yield improvement"
   ```

**Outcome:** Farmer plants Sorghum on October 29 (optimal date), expects 4,375 kg yield with 26% risk.

---

### Workflow 2: In-Season Monitoring (The Field Scout)

**Goal:** Detect pest problems early and treat appropriately.

**Steps:**

1. **Weekly Photo Upload**
   ```
   Farmer takes photo of maize leaves
   App calls: /api/scout/diagnose-severity (image=photo)
   AI diagnosis: "Fall Armyworm detected (88% confidence)"
   ```

2. **Severity-Based Treatment**
   ```
   Severity: 3.2/10 (moderate)
   Treatment strategy: "Enhanced organic (Bt spray + neem)"
   Farmer applies Bt spray within 3 days
   ```

3. **Nutrient Deficiency Detection**
   ```
   After 4 weeks of photos:
   App calls: /api/scout/nutrient-analysis
   AI diagnosis: "Nitrogen deficiency (moderate)"
   Alert: "üå± Pull forward fertilizer by 5 days. Apply CAN 50 kg/acre NOW."
   ```

4. **Contagion Alert**
   ```
   If multiple neighbors report Fall Armyworm:
   App calls: /api/scout/contagion-analysis
   AI detects: "Wind-driven outbreak spreading Southeast at 2.8 km/day"
   Regional alert: "üêõ OUTBREAK WARNING: Inspect crops DAILY"
   ```

**Outcome:** Farmer treats pest early (moderate stage), saves crop, and gets timely fertilizer alert from photos (saves 500 KES on soil testing).
