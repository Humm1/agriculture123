# üéâ BLE Storage Monitoring Feature - Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

### 1. Backend Services (`backend/app/services/`)
Three new service modules to power the BLE storage monitoring feature:

#### `persistence.py`
- Simple JSON-based storage for sensor readings, crop profiles, farmer settings, and alert logs
- Functions:
  - `append_readings()` ‚Äì Store sensor data batch
  - `get_readings()` ‚Äì Retrieve historical data
  - `load_crop_profiles()` / `save_crop_profiles()` ‚Äì Manage crop environmental ranges
  - `set_farmer_settings()` / `get_farmer_settings()` ‚Äì Store farmer preferences
  - `log_alert()` ‚Äì Record alert history

#### `advice.py`
- Evaluates sensor readings against crop-specific thresholds
- Generates localized, actionable alert messages
- Functions:
  - `evaluate_reading()` ‚Äì Compare temp/humidity to crop profile
  - `format_message()` ‚Äì Create emoji-rich alerts in English or Swahili

#### `sms_provider.py`
- Abstraction for SMS sending with Twilio gateway support
- Falls back to logging if Twilio not configured
- Function: `send_sms()` ‚Äì Send alert via SMS or log

### 2. New API Endpoints (`backend/app/routes/storage.py`)

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/storage/crop_profiles` | GET | Retrieve all crop profiles |
| `/api/storage/crop_profiles` | POST | Update crop profiles (admin) |
| `/api/storage/ble/upload` | POST | Upload BLE sensor readings from phone |
| `/api/storage/history` | GET | Retrieve sensor reading history |
| `/api/storage/select_crop` | POST | Set farmer's crop and language preference |
| `/api/storage/trigger_check` | POST | Manually trigger alert evaluation |

---

### 3. Default Crop Profiles
Pre-configured safe storage ranges for:
- **Maize**: 10-25¬∞C, 50-70% humidity
- **Potatoes**: 4-10¬∞C, 85-95% humidity
- **Rice**: 12-18¬∞C, 60-70% humidity (sample)
- **Cassava**: 0-5¬∞C, 85-90% humidity (sample)
- **Beans**: 10-20¬∞C, 50-65% humidity (sample)
- **Onions**: 0-4¬∞C, 65-70% humidity (sample)

---

### 4. Localization Support
Two languages implemented:
- **English** (`en`)
- **Swahili** (`sw`)

Example alerts:
- üå°Ô∏è **Too Hot (English)**: "‚òÄÔ∏è DANGER: maize store is TOO WARM (30¬∞C). Open vents tonight and increase airflow."
- üå°Ô∏è **Too Hot (Swahili)**: "‚òÄÔ∏è HATARI: Hifadhi ya maize ina JOTO JAA (30¬∞C). Open vents tonight and increase airflow."
- üíß **Too Humid (Swahili)**: "üíß HATARI: Unyevu ni 80%. Hatari ya ukungu kwa maize. Increase airflow NOW and reduce humidity; consider drying."

---

### 5. Tests (`backend/tests/test_advice.py`)
Unit tests for:
- Crop profile evaluation (maize, potatoes)
- Alert level detection (ok, too_hot, too_cold, too_humid)
- Message formatting in multiple languages

**All tests pass! ‚úÖ**

---

### 6. Documentation

#### Files Created:
- **`backend/BLE_STORAGE_README.md`** ‚Äì Full feature documentation with API specs
- **`backend/BLE_API_EXAMPLES.md`** ‚Äì Example curl commands and payloads
- **`backend/requirements.txt`** ‚Äì Python dependencies (FastAPI, Pydantic, optional Twilio)
- **`backend/run_dev.py`** ‚Äì Quick development server launcher
- **`backend/sample_crop_profiles.json`** ‚Äì Sample crop profiles for 6 crops

#### Updated:
- **`README.md`** ‚Äì Added BLE storage feature section with quick-start guide

## How It Works

### Farmer's Workflow:
1. **Setup**: Farmer places BLE sensor in storage shed
2. **Data Collection**: Phone app connects to sensor via Bluetooth when farmer is nearby
3. **Upload**: App sends batch readings to `/api/storage/ble/upload`
4. **Evaluation**: Backend checks latest reading against crop profile
5. **Alert**: If unsafe conditions detected, backend:
   - Generates localized message
   - Attempts SMS send via Twilio (if configured)
   - Returns message to app for local SMS fallback
6. **History**: Farmer can view trends via `/api/storage/history`

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional):
```bash
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export TWILIO_TOKEN=your_auth_token
export TWILIO_FROM=+1234567890
```

Without these, alerts are logged to console instead of sent via SMS.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Backend
```bash
python backend/run_dev.py
```

### 3. Test API
Open http://localhost:8000/docs for interactive API documentation

### 4. Run Tests
```bash
python backend/tests/test_advice.py
```

## Mobile App Integration

The phone app should:
1. **Connect to BLE sensors** using platform-specific BLE libraries (React Native BLE PLX, etc.)
2. **Batch readings** and upload to `/api/storage/ble/upload`
3. **Display returned `sms_text`** as in-app notification
4. **Send SMS locally** if `sent_via_gateway: false` (fallback for offline/no backend SMS)
5. **Let farmers select crop** via simple dropdown calling `/api/storage/select_crop`
6. **Show history charts** by fetching `/api/storage/history`

---

## Data Storage

All data persisted in JSON files under `backend/app/data/`:
- `sensor_readings.json` ‚Äì All sensor data
- `crop_profiles.json` ‚Äì Environmental ranges
- `farmer_settings.json` ‚Äì User preferences
- `alerts_log.json` ‚Äì Alert history

**Note**: For production, migrate to SQLite or PostgreSQL for better performance and concurrency.

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add more crops (wheat, millet, etc.)
- [ ] Implement PostgreSQL for persistence
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket alerts
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] Multi-sensor support per farmer
- [ ] Offline-first mobile app with sync
