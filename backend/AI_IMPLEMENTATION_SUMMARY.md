## 🎯 Key Capabilities Added

### A. GPS-Based Intelligence

**What It Does:**
When farmer pins GPS location, AI instantly:
1. Estimates elevation (if not from GPS)
2. Classifies into Kenya farming zone
3. Fetches simulated satellite NDVI (production: real Sentinel-2)
4. Finds nearby farms within 10km
5. Identifies climate risks (drought, frost, fungal diseases)
6. Adjusts growth model (±10% maturity days)

**Example Output:**
```
📍 Your farm in Highland Moderate zone (1650m elevation)
🌡️ Temperature: 15-25°C
💧 Rainfall: 800-1200mm/year
🛰️ NDVI: 0.62 (Excellent vegetation health)
👥 12 nearby farms (Average 3.8km away)
🌾 Popular crops: Maize (7), Beans (4), Potatoes (1)
⚠️ Risk: Seasonal drought (medium) - Use short-season varieties
```

### B. Computer Vision Soil Analysis

**What It Does:**
Analyzes soil photo to estimate:
1. **Color Score** (0-10): Dark = high organic matter
2. **Texture Class**: Clay Loam, Loam, Sandy Loam, Sandy, Sandy Clay
3. **Fertility Score** (0-10): Composite of color + texture + zone
4. **Probable Soil Types**: Top 2 matches with confidence %
5. **Nutrient Status**: Nitrogen (Low/Moderate/Adequate)

**Example Output:**
```
Fertility Score: 7.3/10 (Good)
Color: 7.5 (Medium brown - Moderate organic matter)
Texture: Loam (Balanced, ideal for most crops)
Nitrogen: Moderate
Organic Matter: 2-3%

Probable Types:
• Nitisol (70%) - Well-structured, good for crops
• Acrisol (30%) - Acidic, needs lime

Recommendations:
✅ Excellent soil! Maintain with regular organic additions
```

### C. Crop Variety Risk Assessment

**What It Does:**
Farmer selects variety → AI analyzes:
1. LCRS score (climate risk)
2. Soil fertility from photo
3. Drought tolerance of variety
4. Elevation suitability
5. Historical success rates

**If HIGH RISK** (success rate <60%):
- ⚠️ Shows warning with reasons
- ✅ Recommends better alternative
- 📊 Compares success rates (45% vs 70%)

**Example Output:**
```
⚠️ **Risk Warning:**
H614 has only 45% success rate with your conditions.

Reasons:
- High drought risk (LCRS: 7.2) but variety has MEDIUM tolerance
- Soil fertility below requirement (needs 7.5, you have 6.0)

✅ **Recommended Alternative:**
Drought Tolerant (DH04)
- Success Rate: 70%
- Maturity: 105 days
- Drought Tolerance: HIGH
```

### D. Dynamic Weather-Adjusted Calendar

**What It Does:**
Continuously monitors weather and adjusts practice dates:

**Weeding:**
- Heavy rain + Wet soil → Delay 2 days (avoid compaction)
- Overdue + Dry → Do TODAY (weeds establishing)
- Rain tomorrow → Advance 1 day (weed BEFORE rain)

**Fertilizer:**
- Heavy rain forecast (>40mm) → Delay 5 days (avoid 60% leaching)
- Moderate rain (15-40mm) → Apply NOW (ideal conditions)
- Very dry (<10mm) → Wait 3 days (nutrients won't dissolve)

**Pest Scouting:**
- Hot + Dry → URGENT TODAY (aphid risk)
- Wet + Warm → Scout TODAY (caterpillar risk)

**Example Alert:**
```
⏸️ **Weeding - Date DELAYED**
Original: Oct 25 → New: Oct 27 (+2 days)

Reasons:
- Heavy rain last week (65mm)
- More rain forecast (28mm next 3 days)
- Soil too wet - weeding would compact soil
- **Action:** Wait 2 days for soil to dry
```

### E. Leaching-Optimized Fertilizer Timing

**What It Does:**
Analyzes:
1. **Fertilizer mobility**: Nitrogen (high) > Potassium (medium) > Phosphorus (low)
2. **Soil texture**: Sandy (high leaching) vs Clay (low leaching)
3. **Rainfall**: Recent (past 7 days) + Forecast (next 5 days)
4. **Expected loss**: 5% (low risk) to 60% (extreme risk)

**Finds optimal 5-day window** to:
- Avoid heavy rain (>40mm) → Leaching
- Target moderate rain (15-40mm) → Ideal
- Avoid dry periods → Nutrients won't dissolve

**Example Alert:**
```
🚨 **EXTREME LEACHING RISK**
Original: Nov 5 → New: Nov 9 (+4 days)

Why Wait:
- Heavy rain forecast (55mm) on Nov 6-7
- Sandy soil + Nitrogen = 60% nutrient loss
- Waiting saves ~360 KES per bag

Forecast:
Nov 5: ⛈️ Heavy (60mm)
Nov 6: ⛈️ Heavy (45mm)
Nov 7: 🌧️ Moderate (20mm)
Nov 8: 🌦️ Light (10mm)
Nov 9: ☀️ Dry ← **APPLY HERE**
```

### F. Photo-Based Harvest Refinement

**What It Does:**
Uses weekly photo health scores to adjust harvest window:
- **Ahead of schedule** (health >1.0 above expected) → Harvest 5 days earlier
- **On schedule** (health within ±0.5) → No adjustment
- **Slightly behind** (health -0.5 to -1.5 below) → Extend 5 days
- **Significantly behind** (health <-1.5 below) → Extend 10-14 days

**Example Alert:**
```
⏳ **Harvest Window ADJUSTED**
Original: Feb 15 → New: Feb 20 (+5 days)

Reason:
- Crop slightly stressed early season
- Growth now improving but still behind
- Extra 5 days ensures full maturity

Growth Analysis:
- Average Deviation: -0.8 (Below optimal)
- Trend: Improving
- Data Points: 8 weeks of photos

New Harvest Window:
Start: Feb 20
End: Feb 27
Optimal: Feb 23
```

## 🔗 Integration Flow

### Farm Registration with AI

```
1. Farmer pins GPS → Mobile app captures lat/lon/elevation
2. POST /api/farms/register with enable_ai_analysis=true
3. Backend calls analyze_microclimate_from_gps()
4. AI returns farming zone, NDVI, community insights, risks
5. Backend stores farm record with ai_microclimate_profile
6. Frontend displays AI registration report to farmer
```

### Soil Photo Analysis

```
1. Farmer takes wet soil photo → Upload to cloud storage
2. POST /api/farms/soil-snapshot-simple with enable_ai_analysis=true
3. Backend calls analyze_soil_photo_with_ai()
4. AI analyzes color, texture, fertility, probable types
5. Backend stores snapshot with ai_soil_analysis
6. Frontend displays fertility score, recommendations
```

### Dynamic Practice Adjustments

```
1. Cron job runs daily at 6 AM
2. For each active farm:
   a. Fetch weather forecast from LCRS engine
   b. Get pending practices (next 14 days)
   c. Call get_ai_adjusted_practices()
   d. For each adjusted practice:
      - Send SMS alert if adjustment_days > 2
      - Update farmer dashboard
      - Generate push notification
```

### Fertilizer Timing Optimization

```
1. Practice "Top-dress" due in 7 days
2. System calls get_optimized_fertilizer_timing()
3. AI analyzes:
   - Fertilizer type: Nitrogen (high mobility)
   - Soil texture: Sandy (high leaching risk)
   - Rainfall: 55mm forecast in 2 days
4. AI calculates:
   - Leaching risk: 8.4/10 (EXTREME)
   - Expected loss: 60%
   - Optimal day: +4 days (after heavy rain)
5. Send alert: "🚨 DELAY fertilizer - save 360 KES per bag"
```

### Harvest Window Refinement

```
1. Farmer uploads weekly growth photo
2. System stores health score
3. Every Sunday, system calls get_refined_harvest_window()
4. AI analyzes:
   - 8 weeks of actual scores: [6.5, 7.0, 7.2, 7.8, ...]
   - Expected scores: [6.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, ...]
   - Average deviation: -0.5 (slightly behind)
5. AI adjusts harvest: +5 days (original Feb 15 → Feb 20)
6. Send notification: "⏳ Harvest delayed 5 days due to stress"
```
