# ✅ Registration Flow Fixed!

## Changes Made:

### 1. **Fixed Registration Redirect** 
- ✅ Registration now redirects to Login screen instead of auto-logging in
- ✅ Shows success message before redirecting
- ✅ User must explicitly log in after registration

### 2. **Updated AuthContext**
- ✅ Registration no longer automatically sets user session
- ✅ Forces user to go through proper login flow

### 3. **Added Supabase Database Setup**
- ✅ Created SQL script: `SUPABASE_DATABASE_SETUP.sql`

---

## 🚀 How to Set Up Supabase Database

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Visit: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Click on **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script
1. Click **"New Query"**
2. Copy the contents of `SUPABASE_DATABASE_SETUP.sql`
3. Paste into the SQL editor
4. Click **"Run"** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

### Step 3: Verify Setup
After running the script, you should see:
- ✅ `profiles` table created
- ✅ Row Level Security enabled
- ✅ Triggers set up for automatic profile creation
- ✅ Policies for user access

### Step 4: Verify Table Structure
1. Go to **"Table Editor"** in Supabase
2. Find the `profiles` table
3. It should have these columns:
   - `id` (uuid, primary key)
   - `email` (text)
   - `user_type` (text - 'farmer' or 'buyer')
   - `full_name` (text)
   - `phone_number` (text)
   - `location` (text)
   - `county` (text)
   - `subcounty` (text)
   - `village` (text)
   - `latitude` (double precision)
   - `longitude` (double precision)
   - `created_at` (timestamp)
   - `updated_at` (timestamp)

## 🧪 Test the Registration Flow

### Test Steps:
1. **Restart Expo Server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear --web
   ```

2. **Open the app in browser**: http://localhost:8081

3. **Register a new farmer**:
   - Fill out all required fields
   - Select "Farmer" as user type
   - Click "Register"

4. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ✅ You should see: "Registration Successful! Your account has been created. Please log in to continue."
   - ✅ Click "OK" → Redirected to Login screen
   - ✅ NOT automatically logged in

5. **Verify in Supabase**:
   - Go to **Authentication → Users**
   - You should see the new user email
   - Go to **Table Editor → profiles**
   - You should see the profile record with all details

6. **Log in**:
   - Use the email and password you just registered
   - Should successfully log in and see the Farmer Dashboard

## 📊 Check Browser Console

Open browser developer tools (F12) and check for these logs:

```
🔧 Supabase Configuration:
URL: https://rwspbvgmmxabglptljkg.supabase.co
Key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI...

📝 Starting registration for: [email] as farmer
✅ User signed up: [user-id]
📊 Creating profile in profiles table...
✅ Profile created successfully
```

If you see errors, they'll help us debug!

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "relation 'public.profiles' does not exist"
**Solution**: Run the SQL setup script in Supabase

### Issue 2: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"
**Solution**: User already exists. Try a different email or delete the old user from Supabase

### Issue 3: No logs in console
**Solution**: Make sure browser console is open (F12) and showing all messages

### Issue 4: Registration succeeds but profile not in Supabase
**Solution**: Check the browser console for profile creation errors. The SQL setup script might not have run correctly.
