npm install axios @react-native-async-storage/async-storage @react-native-picker/picker expo-image-picker expo-document-picker
```

### 2. Update Navigation
Add new screens to your navigation stack:

```javascript
// App.js or navigation/AppNavigator.js
import FarmerMarketplace from './src/screens/FarmerMarketplace';
import BuyerMarketplace from './src/screens/BuyerMarketplace';

// Add to stack navigator
<Stack.Screen name="FarmerMarketplace" component={FarmerMarketplace} />
<Stack.Screen name="BuyerMarketplace" component={BuyerMarketplace} />
```

### 3. Configure API Base URL

## Key Features Implementation

### 1. AI Market Insights Display
```javascript
// Renders AI recommendations with optimal selling windows
{marketInsights.insights.map((insight) => (
  <View>
    <Text>{insight.optimal_strategy.ai_recommendation}</Text>
    <Text>Best Window: {insight.optimal_strategy.optimal_sale_window.start_date}</Text>
    <Text>Expected Price: {insight.optimal_strategy.optimal_sale_window.max_price_kes}</Text>
    <Text>Top Option: {insight.optimal_strategy.market_recommendations[0].channel}</Text>
  </View>
))}
```

### 2. Location-Based Search with Distance
```javascript
// PostGIS calculates distance, frontend displays
{searchResults.map((listing) => (
  <View>
    <Text>{listing.crop} - {listing.distance_km.toFixed(1)} km away</Text>
    <Text>Transport: {listing.estimated_transport_cost_kes} KES</Text>
  </View>
))}
```

### 3. M-Pesa Payment Integration
```javascript
// Farmer receives deposit notification
const payDeposit = async (contractId) => {
  Alert.prompt('Enter M-Pesa phone number:', async (phone) => {
    const response = await axios.post(`/pay-deposit/${contractId}`, {
      buyer_id: buyerId,
      phone_number: phone
    });
    // STK Push sent to buyer's phone
  });
};
```

### 4. Supply Forecasting
```javascript
// AI predicts supply in 30/60 days
const viewPredictedSupply = async (crop) => {
  const response = await axios.get('/predicted-supply', {
    params: { buyer_id, crop, days_ahead: 30 }
  });
  
  Alert.alert(
    'Supply Forecast',
    `${response.data.ai_recommendation}\n
    Expected Supply: ${response.data.supply_forecast.total_supply_kg} kg\n
    Price Impact: ${response.data.supply_forecast.expected_price_impact_percent}%`
  );
};
```

### 5. Offer Response System
```javascript
// Farmer can Accept/Counter/Decline offers
const handleOfferResponse = async () => {
  const payload = {
    offer_id: selectedOffer.offer_id,
    action: offerAction, // 'accept', 'counter', or 'decline'
    farmer_notes: farmerNotes
  };
  
  if (offerAction === 'counter') {
    payload.counter_price_kes_per_kg = parseFloat(counterPrice);
    payload.counter_quantity_kg = parseFloat(counterQuantity);
  }
  
  const response = await axios.post('/respond-to-offer', payload);
  
  if (offerAction === 'accept') {
    // Contract created, buyer pays deposit
  } else if (offerAction === 'counter') {
    // Counter-offer sent, 48-hour expiry
  }
};
```

## Color Scheme & Status Indicators

### Status Colors
```javascript
// Listing statuses
active: '#4CAF50'      // Green
sold_out: '#FF9800'    // Orange
expired: '#9E9E9E'     // Gray
deleted: '#F44336'     // Red

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Lazy Loading
```javascript
// Load data only when tab is active
useEffect(() => {
  if (farmerId && activeTab === 'listings') {
    loadListings();
  }
}, [farmerId, activeTab]);
```

### 2. Pull-to-Refresh
```javascript
<ScrollView
  refreshControl={
    <RefreshControl refreshing={refreshing} onRefresh={handleRefresh} />
  }
>
  {/* Content */}
</ScrollView>
```

### 3. Caching with AsyncStorage
```javascript
// Cache farmer/buyer ID
await AsyncStorage.setItem('farmer_id', farmerId);
const cachedId = await AsyncStorage.getItem('farmer_id');
```

---

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Storage**: Store API keys securely using `react-native-dotenv`
2. **Authentication**: Implement JWT token authentication for all API calls
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs before sending to backend
4. **Image Upload Limits**: Restrict to 5 images max per listing
5. **M-Pesa PINs**: Never store M-Pesa PINs in app (handled by Safaricom SDK)

---

## Next Steps for Full Integration

### 1. Database Setup
Create tables for marketplace data (see backend schema in `buyer_marketplace.py`)

### 2. M-Pesa Integration
Implement M-Pesa SDK callbacks:
```python
# backend/app/routes/payments.py
@router.post("/mpesa-callback")
async def mpesa_callback(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
    # Update contract payment status
    persistence.update_contract_payment(
        contract_id=data['AccountReference'],
        status='completed'
    )
```

### 3. Push Notifications
Implement Firebase Cloud Messaging for:
- New offers received
- Offer responses (accepted/countered/declined)
- Deposit paid confirmation
- Delivery notifications
- Payment release confirmations

### 4. E-Logistics Integration
Add tracking screens for:
- Driver assignment
- Real-time GPS tracking
- Delivery ETA
- Proof of delivery (POD)

### 5. Rating System
Add post-transaction rating screens:
- Farmer rates buyer (payment speed, communication)
- Buyer rates farmer (quality, timeliness, honesty)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Buyer not verified" error**
   - Solution: Wait for business verification (24-48 hours) or contact admin

2. **M-Pesa payment fails**
   - Solution: Check phone number format (+254...), ensure sufficient balance

3. **Listings not appearing in search**
   - Solution: Check location permissions, increase search radius

4. **Images not uploading**
   - Solution: Grant camera/gallery permissions, reduce image size

5. **"Contract not found" error**
   - Solution: Refresh contracts list, check buyer/farmer ID matches
