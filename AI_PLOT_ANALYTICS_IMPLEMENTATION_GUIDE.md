## 🤖 AI MODELS (Current & Future)

### Current Implementation (Rule-Based):
- ✅ Color analysis for health scoring
- ✅ Weather-based disease risk
- ✅ Statistical health indicators
- ✅ Cost optimization algorithms

### Future Enhancement (ML Models):
When ready to add trained models:

1. **Disease Detection CNN:**
```python
# In plot_analytics_ai.py
import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('models/disease_detector.h5')
predictions = model.predict(image_array)
```

2. **Health Scoring Model:**
```python
# Multi-output model for different health metrics
health_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('models/health_scorer.h5')
```

3. **Training Data:**
   - All uploaded images stored in `plot_datasets` table
   - Can be exported for model training
   - Labels from user feedback and expert review
