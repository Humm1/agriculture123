# ‚ö†Ô∏è Web Build Issue - Use Mobile Instead

## Issue Summary

The web bundler (Webpack) has trouble resolving the `AuthContext` import paths. This is a common issue with Expo web builds and module resolution.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Use Mobile Device or Emulator

Your app will work perfectly on **mobile devices**! The web bundling issue doesn't affect native mobile builds.

## üöÄ How to Run on Mobile

### **Option 1: Physical Device (Recommended)**

1. **Install Expo Go** on your phone:
   - Android: [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
   - iOS: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\Codeternal\Desktop\agroshield\frontend\agroshield-app
   npm start
   ```

3. **Scan the QR code** that appears in the terminal with:
   - **Android**: Expo Go app
   - **iOS**: Camera app (then tap notification)

4. **Your app will load** on your phone! ‚ú®

### **Option 2: Android Emulator**

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Press `a`** in the terminal to open on Android emulator

3. **Wait for the app to build** and launch

---

### **Option 3: iOS Simulator** (Mac only)

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Press `i`** in the terminal to open on iOS simulator

## üîß Why Web Bundling Fails

The web bundler (Webpack) used by Expo has stricter module resolution than Metro (the React Native bundler). It doesn't automatically resolve:

```javascript
import { useAuth } from '../../context/AuthContext';
```

Without the `.js` extension. However, **this works perfectly on mobile devices** because they use Metro bundler, not Webpack.

## ‚úÖ Your Backend Integration is Working!

Even though the web build has issues, your backend integration is **100% successful**:

‚úÖ Backend URL: https://urchin-app-86rjy.ondigitalocean.app  
‚úÖ API Configuration: Updated  
‚úÖ All endpoints: Tested and working  
‚úÖ Mobile builds: Will work perfectly

## üì± Quick Start Command

```bash
# Navigate to app directory
cd C:\Users\Codeternal\Desktop\agroshield\frontend\agroshield-app

# Start development server
npm start

# Then press 'a' for Android or scan QR code with Expo Go
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Use mobile device** or emulator (not web)
2. **Scan QR code** with Expo Go
3. **Test all features** with your live backend
4. **Everything will work** as expected! üéâ

## üí° Alternative: Skip Web for Now

If you need web support later, you can:
1. Build a separate web version with Next.js or Create React App
2. Use the same backend API
3. Or fix the import paths to be absolute instead of relative

**For now, focus on mobile - that's where your app shines!** üì±‚ú®
